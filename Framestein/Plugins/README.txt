Put your dlls with proper exported perform-functions here, and Framestein
will load them on startup.

Read plugin.h and noize.c and try example-plugins.pd for the whole story.
Pixels.h and green.cpp or tile.cpp demonstrate the easy-to-use pixels-class.

If you write plugins please contribute them to the Framestein distribution.

(type "make" to build plugins in this directory with MS Visual C++.)

NOTE: I'm distributing my Plugins-directory as-is, some of them are
feature-incomplete.
