Framestein will look for filters in this directory in 8BF-format.

The example filters were downloaded from
http://showcase.netins.net/web/wolf359/plugins.htm.

There are more than a thousand more available on that page.

A good program to convert various formats to 8BF is Plugin Commander Light,
available from http://thepluginsite.com/products/picopro/index.htm.

Author & copyright information of the example filters is
stored in the 8BF-files. Thanks for Andrew Buckle for making
his collection available!
