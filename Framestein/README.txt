Framestein is software for processing images and video with Miller Puckette's Pure Data.
For info on Pd, see http://www.pure-data.org.


REQUIREMENTS

Windows with DirectX version 7 or later and Pure Data.


QUICKSTART

Launch Framestein and Pd. From Pd, choose File|Open and try the examples in
Patches-directory, starting with example-basics.pd.

Look inside fs.* objects for more documentation.

Later on, you'll need to start Pd with "pd -path c:\Framestein\Patches"
to tell Pd where to find Framestein's abstractions and externals.
