0.33	()

- closing a patch with a docked fs.frame will no longer kill the fs.frame.
  use fs.vis to make a patch visible and redock any lost docked fs.frames


0.32	(03-02-18)

- added toolbar (just a list of framestein objects & filters for now)
- new plugins: lightspeed, merge_additive, merge_mod, ping, fader
- fs.frame: |title this is the main window( and |undock( commands
- fs.copy: transcolor <r> <g> <b> to set the transparent color
- better gol algo (Plugins\gol.c)
- added row cell automata where each iteration will add a new row: Plugins\rowca
- added arguments-class in pixels.h to ease parsing arguments in plugins.
  example:

  void perform_effect(_frame f, _args a)
  {
	arguments ar(a.s);

	// ar.count()	return the number of arguments
	// ar[i]	return i'th argument
	...
