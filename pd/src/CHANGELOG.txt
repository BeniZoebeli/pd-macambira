This file describes implementation and API changes; stuff more visible to the
user appears in the "release notes" instead.

0.37.1

makefile.in: MANINSTDIR = $(DESTDIR)/$(MANDIR) changed to
    $(DESTDIR)/$(INSTALL_PREFIX)/$(MANDIR) (thx. Mathieu Bouchard)

applied 2 jack patches from Luke Yelavich

add -fno-strict-aliasing to config script (linux&mac) to improve underflow,
etc., protection

add underflow protection to vcf~ object; rewrote underflow protection to be
faster in throw~/catch~ and send~/receive~

fixed bug in -inchannels/-outchannels arg parsing

fixed u_main.tk to make "apple" key work to accelerate menus on MACOS

fooled with MIDI to try to get sysex and other system messages to work.
Needs lots of testing now...

finally fixed OSS to open audio with NODELAY... also cleared dup-on-exec flag.

bug fix in scalar_properties

major editions to the IEM GUIs to fix bugs in how "$" variables are handled.
The code still isn't pretty but hopefully at least works now.

tried to get alsa noninterleaved access to work (needed for RME).  Failed
to get my RME card to load under ALSA and gave up for now.

fixed scalar drawing to fail gracefully when the template canvas disappears

bug fix in vd~ for very small delays (d_delay.c)

set up sys_oldtclversion flag to correct for changed text selection
(u_main.tk, s_main.c, g_rtext.c)

tried again to add "readn" support to s_audio_alsa.c: coded, but failing so far.

fixed broken octave divider example

removed "-Werror" from default makefile; fixed  configure script to respect
"CFLAGS" environment variable instead.  Suggest developers should use
"setenv CFLAGS -Werror".

added "-alsaadd" flag so people can specify alsa devnames to add to list.
fixed some problems with Pd crashing when ALSA failed to open.

took out the 2-pixel padding for MSW in g_canvas.g (HORIZBORDER/VERTBORDER)

went back to s_midi_mmio (portaudio version got assertion errors and anyway
I could never get sysex working in it as I had wanted.)

Took bug fixes from s_midi_pm.c, s_audio_jack.c, s_inter.c from "devel" branch;
also added "static" flag to configure.in (but the devel configure.in as a whole
doesn't seem to work for OSX, for me at least.)
 
Might have fixed a bug where labels disappear in buttons, etc, when saved
and reloaded.

brought s_audio_alsa.c up to alsa 1.0.0 compatibility

fixed "-alsaadd" (never worked before)

fooled with macintosh audio.  Fixed some (not all) of the audio I/O APIs
to deal with open failures better (reducing sys_{in,out}channels accordingly)

In the Alsa API, the synchronization test was too stringent and was loosened
to 3*DACBLKSIZE/2.

'make install' fixed to deal with 'extra' correctly.

one more improvement in jack support (guenter)

make an "nrt" flag so mac can disable pthread_setschedparam call if yu want.
