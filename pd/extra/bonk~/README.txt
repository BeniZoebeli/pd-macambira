This is the README file for the "bonk" percussion detector.  This software
is available from http://man104nfs.ucsd.edu/~mpuckett in versions for
IRIX 5.x and for NT on Intel boxes.

Bonk will soon be available separately for Max/MSP on Macintoshes.

TO INSTALL FOR IRIX 5.x:  download from the Web page, which will give you a
file named "bonk-x.xx.tar.Z" (where x.xx is the version number).  Unpack this
by typing "zcat bonk-x.xx.tar.Z | tar xf -" which will give you a directory
named "bonk" containing the source, the object code, and the "help patch."

TO INSTALL FOR NT:  download from the Web page, which will give you a file
named "bonk-x.xx.zip" (where x.xx is the version number).  Unpack this by
typing "unzip bonk-x.xx.zip" to a terminal window which will give you a
directory named "bonk".  The source, the object code, and the "help patch"
will be there.

Pd currently has no search path facility; the object file (bonk.pd_irix5 or
bonk.dll) should be copied to the directories containing whatever patches you
want to use it with.
