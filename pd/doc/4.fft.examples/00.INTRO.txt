Most of the patches here have moved to section I of the audio examples.
The remaining ones are due for an update but will probably join the
"data" examples.

12.sinedecomposer.pd -- estimate the frequencies and amplitudes of the
components of a sound

13.partialtracer.pd -- sinusoidal analysis/resynthesis of a time-verying sound.
