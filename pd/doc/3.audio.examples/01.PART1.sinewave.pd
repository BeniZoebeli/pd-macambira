#X text 32 195 Audio computation can be turned on and off by sending messages to the global "pd" object as follows:;
#X msg 98 239 \; pd dsp 1;
#X msg 202 239 \; pd dsp 0;
#X text 113 276 ON;
#X text 222 276 OFF;
#X text 29 297 You should see the Pd window change to reflect whether audio is on or off. You can also turn audio on and off using the "audio" menu \, but the buttons are provided as a shortcut.;
#X text 30 368 When DSP is on \, you should hear a tone whose pitch is A 440 and whose amplitude is 0.05. If instead you are greeted with silence \, you might want to read the HTML documentation on setting up audio.;
#X text 28 434 In general when you start a work session with Pd \, you will want to choose "test audio and MIDI" from the help window \, which opens a more comprehensive test patch than this one.;
#X text 32 23 Audio computation in Pd is done using "tilde objects" such as the three below. THey use continuous audio streams to intercommunicate. They can be controlled by sending them messages. A few analysis modules take audio streams in and put control messages back out.;
