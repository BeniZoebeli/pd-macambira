This is the second of three tutorial series on Pd. The first one shows how to
use Pd to do "control" computations.  This one shows the time-domain audio
processing features.

Here is an approximate table of contents...

1. sinusoids
    oscillators
    amplitudes
    frequency and pitch
    FM

2. wavetable synthesis

3. synthetic waveforms, classic and modern
    pulses
    rectangles and sawtooth waves
    additive synthesis

4. sampling

5. envelopes
    two flavors of ADSR envelope
    log/linear conversion

6. control structures
    analog-style sequencing
    monophonic keyboard synthesizer
    sample and hold
    envelope following

7. processing
    filters
    modulation
    delays

8. formant synthesis

9. strategies
    quartic curves in envelopes
    triggering notes from qlists
    order of execution and block size
