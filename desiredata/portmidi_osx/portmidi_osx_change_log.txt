PortMIDI changes of 27 June 2003 by X. J. Scott

pmdarwin.c
----------
- added void parameter list to pm_init and pm_term
  (to remove a compiler warning)
- Pm_GetDefaultInputDeviceID() and Pm_GetDefaultOutputDeviceID()
  now return id of first input and output devices in system,
  rather than returning 0 as before.
  This fix enables valid default port values to be returned.
  0 is returned if no such device is found.

ptdarwin.c
----------
- added void parameter list to Pt_Stop and Pt_Started
  (to remove a compiler warning)
- added void *time_info parameter list to Pt_time
  -> since Pt_Time is assigned in pmmacosx.c:get_timestamp() to
    a variable of type PMTimeProcPtr, which requires this signature.

porttime.h
----------
- added void parameter list to Pt_Stop and Pt_Started
- added void *time_info parameter list to Pt_time

pmmacosx.c
----------
- midi_length():
  fixed bug that gave bad lengths for system messages
  [note that the F5 message may be an issue for someone
  to deal with later since the MIDITimePiece interface appopriated
  the F5 for a two byte long CableSelectID - this usage
  and length differ from the MIDI standard.]

/ pm_macosx_init():
  Now allocates the device names. This fixes bug before where
  it assigned same string buffer on stack to all devices.
- pm_macosx_term(), deleteDeviceName():
  devices strings allocated during pm_macosx_init() are deallocated.

+ pm_macosx_init(), newDeviceName():
  registering kMIDIPropertyManufacturer + kMIDIPropertyModel +
  kMIDIPropertyName for name strings instead of just name.

/ pm_macosx_init():
  unsigned i to quiet compiler griping
- get_timestamp():
  no change right here but type of Pt_Time() was altered in porttime.h
  so it matches type PmTimeProcPtr in assignment in this function.
/ midi_write():
  changed unsigned to signed to stop compiler griping

portmidi.h
----------
- Added void arg to Pm_GetHostError() to stop compiler gripe.

pmtest.c
---------
- Added Initialize and Terminate calls so that it doesn't
  fail the 2nd time the test is run.

PortMIDI changes of 11 Nov 2003 by X. J. Scott

pmmacosx.c
----------
- Handles ports that don't have the full set of property strings.
  This fixes bug where crash would occur if a virtual port was present.
