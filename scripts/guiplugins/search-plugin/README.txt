This is a plugin that searches all of the .pd and .txt files that are in the
included docs and in any libraries that are currently in Pd's path.  The
syntax of the search is either a simple keyword search, i.e. "video" or a Tcl
regular expression (regexp).

You can find out about the Tcl regexp syntax here for advanced searches:
