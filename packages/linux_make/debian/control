Description: Pure Data with patches and a large collection of externals
 Pd (aka Pure Data) is a real-time graphical programming environment for
 audio, video, and graphical processing. It is the third major branch of the
 family of patcher programming languages known as Max (Max/FTS, ISPW Max,
 Max/MSP, jMax, etc.) originally developed by Miller Puckette and company at
 IRCAM. The core of Pd is written and maintained by Miller Puckette and
 includes the work of many developers, making the whole package very much a
 community effort.
 .
 Pd was created to explore ideas of how to further refine the Max paradigm
 with the core ideas of allowing data to be treated in a more open-ended way
 and opening it up to applications outside of audio and MIDI, such as graphics
 and video.
 .
 This distribution of Pd includes a wide array of libraries that allow
 you to work with HIDs, video, OpenGL 3D graphics, and more.
