- make sure vasp is included in noncvs

- check out using env vars in Path settings in registry, or make relative paths

  possibly some link pointing to the wrong place?  It turns out that the
  rundll "open" thingy isn't working...
      - make Pd.exe using MSYS's "start.exe" like MacOSX's "open"
      - menu_openhtml on Win32 with rundll should be able to open other
        filetypes like open on MACOSX.


- get Windows Makefiles for Gem
