- test 7zip format for the installer packages, make sure it'll run on all
  platforms.  Its better to use 7zip since its smaller, and its free.


- make things compile in Cygwin's MinGW environment (then things can be
  compiled from an ssh session)


- switch to Martin Peach's menu_openhtml patch, it handles names with spaces
  better (i.e. replace openhtml_win32_fix-0.39-2.patch)


- make DLLs install into %SystemRoot%\system32 instead of %ProgramFiles%\pd\bin


- check out using env vars in Path settings in registry, or make relative
  paths (I checked, you can't use env vars in the path or loadlib
  settings... arg, this should be implemented)


- get Windows Makefiles for Gem


- make gripd compile from source (then we don't need to include pthreadVC.dll
  from Miller's pd package, and other hacks)
