- add SMlib from email from Anders

- add Gem to noncvs

- get Pd compiling on MinGW:.  From Carmen: 
  
  - "theres a SConscript in devel_0_39 and theres also a makefile.mingw maybe
  	 in devel_0_38. just ./configure && make && make install the deps like tk
  	 and such first, although you can use a static path to MSVC-generated .libs
  	 if you dont feel like doing that.."


- make Pd.exe using MinGW's "start.exe" like MacOSX's "open"

- menu_openhtml on Win32 with rundll should be able to open other filetypes like open on MACOSX.

- fix PD_VERSION, the sed patterns aren't working

- figure out why MinGW-compiled "unauthorized" externals don't work

- get Windows Makefiles for Gem, unauthorized
