- check out dynamic linking in ogg* objects, and included DLL if needed

- check out using env vars in Path settings in registry, or make relative paths

- Another detail is that the menu item "help/1 manual" results in no action -
  possibly some link pointing to the wrong place?  It turns out that the
  rundll "open" thingy isn't working...
      - make Pd.exe using MinGW's "start.exe" like MacOSX's "open"
      - menu_openhtml on Win32 with rundll should be able to open other
        filetypes like open on MACOSX.


- get Pd compiling on MinGW:.  From Carmen: 
  
  - "theres a SConscript in devel_0_39 and theres also a makefile.mingw maybe
  	 in devel_0_38. just ./configure && make && make install the deps like tk
  	 and such first, although you can use a static path to MSVC-generated .libs
  	 if you dont feel like doing that.."


- get Windows Makefiles for Gem
