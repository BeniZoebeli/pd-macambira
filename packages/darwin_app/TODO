- check to make sure that Rez mac.r is working in Makefile

- make Pd open a new window when its launched to workaround the bug where the
  menus don't work until a window is opened.

- otool dylib help: http://qin.laya.com/tech_coding_help/dylib_linking.html

- add symbolic link for flext 
  (cd Pd.app/Contents/Resources/extra && ln -s . lib)

- from Carmen Rocco about [fiddle~] crash: "is fiddle~: * compiled with the same header * linked with the same binary of (lib)pd * compiled with the same compiler? i had very similar issues with bonk on windows (Virtually same stacktrace but s/fiddle/bonk) until fixing the above 3 things..."

- review permissions so that you can build on top on existing builds

- add standard paths to included org.puredata.pd.plist following these
  guidelines:
http://developer.apple.com/documentation/MacOSX/Conceptual/BPFileSystem/Articles/WhereToPutFiles.html

- help menu

  	 - check up on this bug: Opening Help patches from "Pure Documentation"
   
    - make help menu function check if item exists before trying to make a
      menu item so that it doesn't break pd.tk<->pd interaction (i.e. windows
      titled x50bf90).  (the recursive function might have fixed this)

- try this for the Pref Pane:
 kAEShowPreferences ::tk::mac::ShowPreferences

- research Tcl "auto_path"

- research Tk + "Custom MDEF" for menus

- create Tcl script called from Prefs that creates links for the standard unix
- locations for files that are in bin, include, man inside $(PD_FILE_ROOT)

- redo menu system
  		 - the menus are the same for all windows
		 - instead of hiding menus, grey-out/disable menu items on Pd window
		 - one method for creating all menus
		 - Pd window has method which disables menus
		 - flash menu when accelerator hits
		 - fix edit mode menu item (make it a checkbox or change to "play mode"

- redo key mapping system
		 - make Cmd-Delete also delete, as well as just Delete, so that my
		   Finder key command habits work in Pd as well
		 - make Cmd-click work like Ctrl-click

- write script to convert from -DMACOSX to -D__APPLE__ where ever possible (check out
  __gnu_linux__ while I am at it) and submit to miller

- instead of shipping Pd.app with a org.puredata.pd.plist, make a script that
  uses the "defaults" command to add the desired prefs to any existing
  file. (its a good idea, but unforunately, the key names prevent that from
  working, i.e. loadlib1, loadlib2, etc)

semi-abandoned TODOs

- make a web page that has stuff that can't be included due to license issues:
  (percolate)
