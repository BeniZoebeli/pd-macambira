- check out using TclTkBI package for all of the tcl deps.  It should have all
  of the binaries necessary for extensions/gui/ix

     - research Tcl "auto_path"


- make Pd open a new window when its launched to workaround the bug where the
  menus don't work until a window is opened.

	 Now that we have copied the Qt library into the bundle, we must update
	 both the library and the executable so that they know where they can be
	 found. This is where the install_name_tool command-line tool comes in
	 handy. For the Qt library:

    install_name_tool \
        -id @executable_path/../Frameworks/libqt.3.dylib \
        demo.app/Contents/Frameworks/libqt.3.dylib
    
    otool -L oggcast~.pd_darwin | grep /sw/ | sed -n 's|.*/sw/lib/\(.*\.dylib\).*|\1|p'


- from Carmen Rocco about [fiddle~] crash: "is fiddle~: * compiled with the
  same header * linked with the same binary of (lib)pd * compiled with the
  same compiler? i had very similar issues with bonk on windows (Virtually
  same stacktrace but s/fiddle/bonk) until fixing the above 3 things..."


- review permissions so that you can build on top on existing builds (its the Frameworks)


- add standard paths to included org.puredata.pd.plist following these
  guidelines:

- Pd should then test to see if Jack is available before switching to it,
  otherwise it'll just crash.  Here's apple's method of testing:

- try this for the Pref Pane:
 kAEShowPreferences ::tk::mac::ShowPreferences


- research Tk + "Custom MDEF" for menus


- create Tcl script called from Prefs that creates links for the standard unix


- redo menu system
  		 - the menus are the same for all windows
		 - instead of hiding menus, grey-out/disable menu items on Pd window
		 - one method for creating all menus
		 - Pd window has method which disables menus
		 - flash menu when accelerator hits
		 - fix edit mode menu item (make it a checkbox or change to "play mode"


- redo key mapping system
		 - make Cmd-Delete also delete, as well as just Delete, so that my
		   Finder key command habits work in Pd as well
		 - make Cmd-click work like Ctrl-click


- write script to convert from -DMACOSX to -D__APPLE__ where ever possible (check out
  __gnu_linux__ and WIN32 while I am at it) and submit to miller


- instead of shipping Pd.app with a org.puredata.pd.plist, make a script that
  uses the "defaults" command to add the desired prefs to any existing
  file. (its a good idea, but unforunately, the key names prevent that from
  working, i.e. loadlib1, loadlib2, etc)

semi-abandoned TODOs

- make a web page that has stuff that can't be included due to license issues:
