- OSC did not get included

- check out embed-MacOSX-dependencies.sh script.  There seems to be a bug
  where the deps in lib/libogg.dylib don't get switched from /sw/lib to
  @executable_path/blah/blah


- check out using TclTkBI package for all of the tcl deps.  It should have all
  of the binaries necessary for extensions/gui/ix

     - research Tcl "auto_path"


- from Carmen Rocco about [fiddle~] crash: "is fiddle~: * compiled with the
  same header * linked with the same binary of (lib)pd * compiled with the
  same compiler? i had very similar issues with bonk on windows (Virtually
  same stacktrace but s/fiddle/bonk) until fixing the above 3 things..."


- review permissions so that you can build on top on existing builds (its the
  Frameworks, just chmod -R +w after installingx)


- add standard paths to included org.puredata.pd.plist following these
  guidelines:
http://developer.apple.com/documentation/MacOSX/Conceptual/BPFileSystem/Articles/WhereToPutFiles.html


- try this for the Pref Pane:
 kAEShowPreferences ::tk::mac::ShowPreferences



- create Tcl script called from Prefs that creates links for the standard unix


- redo menu system
  	   	 - research Tk + "Custom MDEF" for menus
  		 - the menus are the same for all windows
		 - instead of hiding menus, grey-out/disable menu items on Pd window
		 - one method for creating all menus
		 - Pd window has method which disables menus
		 - flash menu when accelerator hits
		 - fix edit mode menu item (make it a checkbox or change to "play mode"


- redo key mapping system
		 - make Cmd-Delete also delete, as well as just Delete, so that my
		   Finder key command habits work in Pd as well
		 - make Cmd-click work like Ctrl-click


- write script to convert from -DMACOSX to -D__APPLE__ where ever possible (check out
  __gnu_linux__ and WIN32 while I am at it) and submit to miller


- Pd should then test to see if Jack is available before switching to it,
  otherwise it'll just crash.  Here's apple's method of testing:

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
semi-abandoned TODOs

- make a web page that has stuff that can't be included due to license issues:
  (percolate)

- instead of shipping Pd.app with a org.puredata.pd.plist, make a script that
  uses the "defaults" command to add the desired prefs to any existing
  file. (its a good idea, but unforunately, the key names prevent that from
  working, i.e. loadlib1, loadlib2, etc)
