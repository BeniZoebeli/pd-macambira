<H2>Random Pd Externals</H2>

<P>
This is a collection of random binaries I found on the net.  There is no
		guarantee that they'll work for you.  Consider this stuff very alpha. 
You will inevitably need to install some other stuff to get these working.
		For example, both GEM and PDP need a number of external libraries.  The
		best way to get these is to use http://fink.sf.net .

These are the included binary packages:

<LI>IEMlib 1.12</LI>
