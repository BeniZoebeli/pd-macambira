- fix transparent file icon pd-file.icns

- the .pkg names should probably not have the version in them. The installer
  then doesn't recognize that it is upgrading a package, since the package
  name is different.  This doesn't matter yet since an upgrade doesn't behave
  any differently.

- alt stops working/doesn't work?

- shift sometimes does not work with multiple selections

- right-click menu sometimes comes up about 10 pixels to the right of where
  it should be.

- many unauthorized externals don't work.  try -bundle_loader ../../../pd/bin/pd
- externals/sprinkler doesn't compile

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
DONE?

- The installer selects the System Disk by default as the disk to install
  to but it doesn't allow you to install there. You have to either click "Go
  Back" then "Continue" or click on another disk, then click on the System Disk.
- help files don't load properly (can't seem to find anymore broken ones)

- Gem help files don't load due to path problem

- "compute audio" checkbox only refreshes when you click on the Pd window
