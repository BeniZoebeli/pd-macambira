- zexy crashes with an error due to _z_wrap_setup

- maxlib/unauthorized/etc. help files don't load properly

- The installer selects the System Disk by default as the disk to install
  to but it doesn't allow you to install there. You have to either click "Go
  Back" then "Continue" or click on another disk, then click on the System Disk.

- the .pkg names should probably non have the version in them. The installer
  then doesn't recognize that it is upgrading a package, since the package
  name is different.
