This directory is for files that are used in the creation of MacOS X
installer .pkgs and .dmgs.  In order to use this to compile Pd and externals,
you need to have sudo/admin access and this directory structure:

 +-|
	+-abstractions
	|
   +-darwin-pkg
	|
	+-doc-|
	|	   +-additional
	|	   +-pddp
	|	   +-tutorials
	|
	+-externals-|
	|			   +-...
	|			   +-ext13
	|			   +-ggee
	|			   +-maxlib
	|				+-unauthorized
	|			   +-zexy
	|   		   +-...
	|
	+-pd-|
		  +-src
		  +-doc
		  +-etc...

	
The recommended way to do this is:

	 mkdir pure-data && cd pure-data
	 setenv CVSROOT :pserver:anonymous@cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/pure-data
	 tar xzf pd-0.37.tar.gz (or cvs checkout -r devel_0_37 pd )
	 ln -s pd-0.37.0 pd
	 cvs checkout darwin-pkg
	 cvs checkout doc
	 cvs checkout externals
	 cd darwin-pkg
 	 make clean && make

You'll need to have a compiled version of Pd installed into /usr/local/bin/pd
that is the same minor version as the one you are compiling into the package
(e.g. 0.36-*, 0.37-*, etc).  This is necessary for this linker flag:

-bundle_loader /usr/local/bin/pd

This should probably be changed to be a relative path so that you can use the
pd version that you are compiling to link with.
