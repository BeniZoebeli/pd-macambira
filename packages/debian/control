Description: realtime computer music and graphics system 
 A real-time graphical programming environment for audio and graphics
 analysis and rendering.  Pd's audio functions are built-in; graphical
 computations require a separate package named GEM ("Graphics Environment for
 Multimedia").  Pd and GEM are available for SGI machines, IBM PC compatibles
 (running NT or W95) and Linux (PCs or Alpha machines).
