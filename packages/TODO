- make abstraction -lib loader.  when a -lib mylibrary name is tried and fails
  in the path, then fails with IO's altname, then try to load as a path on top
  of extra: i.e. extra/mylibrary.  If found, add to path, and add
  doc/5.reference/mylibrary to helppath.  

    - call it sys_load_lib_folder();, 

	 - insert it after  if (!sys_load_lib()) in s_main.c

- make pd section since I can't easily modify the pd tree

- add notes.txt to manuals

- create patch system and incorporate IO's hex patch

- hex convertor for setup function names, and object file names

- merge in tigital's Makefile++

- move purepd to abstractions 

- add GRIPD for Anders

- add reg keys for Martin Dupras

- mDNS objects!

- import nqpoly4 and write helpfiles based on website: 
  			http://pix.test.at/pd/nqpoly/nqpoly4.html

- global versioning system
  		the package releases should have versions of there own which apply to
  		all packages, regardless of format or OS.  This will make for easy and
  		seemless cross-platform work.

- global optimization flags
  		ideally, you would use a version of Pd that is fully optimized for your
  		CPU.  In order to do this, a system of optimization flags needs to be
  		developed so that you can specific the target CPU in one place and have
  		everything compile for that CPU.
