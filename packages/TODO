- move darwin_app_perms to here and make generic prerelease_clean target which
  is called separately

- fix scripts/checkout...sh.  It doesn't cvs co into the newly created pure-data folder

- rename "applications" to "examples"

- downcase *_DEST and *_SRC to be more readable

- On GNU/Linux, figure out how to deal with build/extra vs. build/lib/pd/extra

- global optimization flags
  		ideally, you would use a version of Pd that is fully optimized for your
  		CPU.  In order to do this, a system of optimization flags needs to be
  		developed so that you can specific the target CPU in one place and have
  		everything compile for that CPU.

- add GRIPD for Anders

- add reg keys for Martin Dupras

- mDNS objects!

- make standard targets: distclean (*~, etc.), installdirs (make just the
  dirs), uninstall instead of install_clean

- help menu

  	 - check up on this bug: Opening Help patches from "Pure Documentation"
   
    - make help menu function check if item exists before trying to make a
      menu item so that it doesn't break pd.tk<->pd interaction (i.e. windows
      titled x50bf90).  (the recursive function might have fixed this)

	 - port to Linux/Windows

- Preferences

	 - look at BBogart's LML http://www.ekran.org/ben/research/lml/lml-v0.1-TEST8-osx.tgz
