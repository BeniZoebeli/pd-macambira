- output the compilation flags to the resulting package so that different
  builds with the same name can be distinguished

- for release branch, remove class_sethelpsymbol() from iemlib and zexy

- make a web page that has stuff that can't be included due to license and patent issues:
  (percolate, mp3, mpeg2, mpeg4, etc)

- make all of pd/src/x_*.c into a standalone library that is optionally loaded
  by Pd.  Then these objects can be placed into the namespace.


- allow DESTDIR to be a relative path


- fiddle~, bonk~, etc. didn't get installed


- try out FFTW patch from patch tracker (it applies fine, but the build system
  needs to set the define to enable it).


- document generate-libdir-metafile.sh


- move darwin_app_perms to here and make generic prerelease_clean target which
  is called separately


- test for "configure" before running autoconf, also rm "configure" on distclean


- global optimization flags
  		ideally, you would use a version of Pd that is fully optimized for your
  		CPU.  In order to do this, a system of optimization flags needs to be
  		developed so that you can specific the target CPU in one place and have
  		everything compile for that CPU.


- make standard targets: distclean (*~, etc.), uninstall instead of install_clean


- adding flext (from tgrill) "you could take the templates, *.def in the
  buildsys hierarchy from which the original config*.txt files are
  generated. These don't make assumptions about CPU etc. and should therefore
  be portable"
