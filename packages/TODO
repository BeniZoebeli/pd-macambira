- global optimization flags
  		ideally, you would use a version of Pd that is fully optimized for your
  		CPU.  In order to do this, a system of optimization flags needs to be
  		developed so that you can specific the target CPU in one place and have
  		everything compile for that CPU.

- document libdir format

- add GRIPD for Anders

- add reg keys for Martin Dupras
