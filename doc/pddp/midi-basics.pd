#X text 59 6 MIDI basics.;
#X text 11 54 MIDI in PD is handled through the 'raw' midi devices
(such as /dev/midi*). One could specify which MIDI port PD is supposed
to use through a command line switch when starting PD \, i.e.:;
#X text 35 126 pd -midiindev 1 -midioutdev 2;
#X text 43 287 pd -mididev 1;
#X text 17 315 This will use the first port for both MIDI input and
output.;
#X text 17 397 There is also a little bit of confusion about OSS midi
(which uses the raw midi - /dev/midi* - devices by default) and ALSA
(which is becoming very popular). ALSA uses /dev/snd/midiC*D* as their
raw midi devices. The C* (* = some number) is the device number while
D* (* = some number) is the port number. Normally the ALSA driver links
its raw devices to the corresponding /dev/midi* automatically (i.e.:
/dev/snd/midiC0d0 -> /dev/midi00 \, /dev/snd/midiC0D1 -> /dev/midi01
etc).;
#X text 13 150 so \, the above will use the first MIDI device for MIDI
input (it could be a MIDI controller such as a keyboard \, midi-guitar
\, midi knob box etc) and the device #2 will be used for outputting
the MIDI (re)generated or sent by PD.;
#X text 13 232 For using the same device for MIDI input AND output
(i.e. when one uses a MIDI keyboard which is also a synthesizer) the
following command line switch will do:;
#X text 19 521 MIDI objects in PD (the ones that read and write to
MIDI ports) take a MIDI channel as an argument. Channels 1-16 use the
first MIDI device \, 17-32 use the second MIDI device and so on. For
this to work one must specify which devices PD is supposed to use:
;
#X text 39 599 -midiindev 1 \, 2 -- use devices 1 and 2 for input;
#X text 39 615 -midioutdev 1 \, 2 -- use devices 1 and 2 for output
;
#X text 39 631 -mididev 1 \, 2 -- use devices 1 and 2 for input and
output;
#X text 17 343 NOTE (Linux): PD counts the MIDI devices starting from
1 Usually \, the operating system counts them starting with 0 (zero)
so if you want to use /dev/midi00 \, PD has to be started with -mididev
1 Always add 1 to the device number.;
#X text 21 651 NOTE (Windows): -listdev command line option lists all
available MIDI and audio devices.;
#X text 19 678 A couple more useful command line options (related to
MIDI):;
#X text 21 694 -nomidiin -- do not listen to any midi input;
#X text 21 706 -nomidiout -- do not send any midi output;
#X text 21 718 -nomidi -- do not use any MIDI;
