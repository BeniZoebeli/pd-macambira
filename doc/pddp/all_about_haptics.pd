#X text 20 41 "Haptic" means relating to the sense of touch. Haptic
feedback relates to the sense of touch at the skin level \, and the
feeling of forces in the muscles and joints. Vibrations stimulate the
sense of touch while various forces stimulate the muscles.;
#X text 20 118 There are many haptic devices available \, from a US$35
Logitech iFeel mouse \, to the massive \, extremely expensive haptic
devices used for remote control surgery. Immersion \, Inc. has almost
a monopoly on this technology due to a number of patents. These objects
all work with Immersion technology \, generally known as "TouchSense".

#X text 21 207 Numerous companies produce haptic game controllers:
mice \, joysticks \, gamepads \, steering wheels. These objects work
with game controllers.;
