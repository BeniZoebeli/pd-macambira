will force each of Pd's stop-watches \, [timer] [cputime] and [realtime]
to measure various processes and report the elapsed time. Click on

#X text 472 36 WHY THE DISCREPANCIES BETWEEN CLOCKS?;
#X text 475 59 In a fantasy world \, computers could exist somehow
beyond the restrictions of time and digital computation could be performed
in ZERO time. However \, that is not the case. Instead \, every process
within Pd and within your operating system requires at least a few
nanoseconds of your CPU's time.;

#X text 476 144 The [timer] object is like a clock that is not constrained
to the regular laws of physics and the universal space-time continuum.
It reports "time" measurements as only Pd can see them!;
#X text 477 204 The [cputime] object is like a clock that measures
how much time your CPU actually required to carry out your request.
Keep in mind however that your CPU is busy doing many things simoultaneously
\, so even though a process might take 5 minutes to complete \, your
CPU does not pay full attention to that process for the entire 5 minutes.
Instead \, it simply begins the process \, then refers back to that
process from time to time until the it is complete. In other cases
\, your CPU might require a full 5 minutes while Pd might report that
merely a few milliseconds have passed. This type of discrepancy depends
heavily on your computer's hardware and the type of processing it is
performing.;
#X text 478 368 The [realtime] object is as much like your own wrist
watch as Pd can possibly manage. It measures time according to your
operating system's internal clock.;

;
#X text 11 185 [realtime] works like essentially like a stop-watch.
Once it starts \, you can continue to "poll" [realtime] to view the
elapsed time.;
#X text 11 232 The odd aspect about comparing [realtime] to a stop-watch
is that a stop-watch can be stopped! [realtime] can only be started
or reset. It cannot be stopped.;
#X text 9 282 As stated above \, [realtime] measures "real" or actual
time. This value may be slightly different that CPU time or "logical"
time. Pd offers two objects which measure CPU time and "logical" time.
See the reference documents for those objects for more information.
