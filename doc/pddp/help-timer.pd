#X text 13 44 The [timer] object measures elapsed logical time. Logical
time moves forward as if all computation were instantaneous and as
if all [delay] and [metro] objects were exact.;
#X text 11 185 [timer] works like essentially like a stop-watch. Once
it starts \, you can continue to "poll" the [timer] to view the elapsed
time.;
#X text 81 114 Click here to get elapsed logical time. Click again...and
again...to see periodic measurements from the start or reset time.
;
#X text 10 282 As stated above \, [timer] measures "logical" time.
This value may be slightly different that CPU time or "real" time.
PD offers two objects which measure CPU time and "real" time. See the
reference documents for those objects for more information.;

which will force each of PD's stop-watches \, [timer] [cputime] and
[realtime] to measure various processes and report the elapsed time.

#X text 472 36 WHY THE DISCREPANCIES BETWEEN CLOCKS?;
#X text 475 59 In a fantasy world \, computers could exist somehow
beyond the restrictions of time and digital computation could be performed
in ZERO time. However \, that is not the case. Instead \, every process
within PD and within your operating system requires at least a few
nanoseconds of your CPU's time.;

#X text 476 144 The [timer] object is like a clock that is not constrained
to the regular laws of physics and the universal space-time continuum.
It reports "time" measurements as only PD can see them!;
#X text 477 204 The [cputime] object is like a clock that measures
how much time your CPU actually required to carry out your request.
Keep in mind however that your CPU is busy doing many things simoultaneously
\, so even though a process might take 5 minutes to complete \, your
CPU does not pay full attention to that process for the entire 5 minutes.
Instead \, it simply begins the process \, then refers back to that
process from time to time until the it is complete. In other cases
\, your CPU might require a full 5 minutes while PD might report that
merely a few milliseconds have passed. This type of discrepancy depends
heavily on your computer's hardware and the type of processing it is
performing.;
#X text 478 368 The [realtime] object is as much like your own wrist
watch as PD can possibly manage. It measures time according to your
operating system's internal clock.;
