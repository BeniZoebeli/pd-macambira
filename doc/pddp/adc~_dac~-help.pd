#X text 12 24 SAMPLE RATE;
#X text 29 46 [adc~] and [dac~] always operate at the sample rate that
is specified in Pd's command line. By default \, the sample rate is
44100 hz. But Pd operates any sample rate supported by standard audio
hardware. Sample rates cannot be changed at run-time in Pd \, but must
be stated in the command line when Pd is instantiated. As well \, two
or more instances of Pd running simoultaneously can each be using different
sample rates! Having said that \, Pd can easily upsample or downsample
by using the [block~] object. Here are some example of the common sample
rates:;

#X text 16 13 MULTI-CHANNEL AUDIO;
#X text 32 40 All sound cards are capable of at least two channels
of audio. Pd supports these two channels by default and uses your system's
generic audio drivers to communicate with your hardware. However \,
for faster input/output and for more than two channels of audio \,
PD incorporates the use of "PortAudio" which uses ASIO drivers to communicate
with your hardware. So \, to instruct Pd to use more than two channels
of audio \, your command line should read like below:;
#X text 93 182 c:/pd/bin/pd.exe -pa -inchannels 8 -outchannels 8;
#X text 32 211 The "-pa" switch means "PortAudio". This switch is new
as of Pd version 0.37 TEST 4 and replaces the old "-asio" switch.;
#X text 32 271 The "-inchannels" and "-outchannels" switches can be
summarized by using "-channels 8" because currently PortAudio requires
that the number of incoming and outgoing channels must be equal. This
may change in the Pd's future...;
#X text 32 361 To further optimize Pd's usage of your audio hardware
\, you can explore the following:;
#X text 42 402 - audiobuf;
#X text 43 420 - blocksize;
#X text 42 436 - audioindev;
#X text 42 454 - audiooutdev;
#X text 38 480 With the right hardware \, Pd can manage audio input
and output with lower than 10 milliseconds of latency.;

#X text 21 15 -NODAC and -NOADC;
#X text 26 37 There may be cases when you do not want Pd to send or
receive audio signal with your soundcard. You can manually disable
the [dac~] and [adc~] objects separately using the "-nodac" and "-noadc"
switch \, or disable both using the "-nosound" switch.;

#X text 104 47 [adc~] and [dac~] provide real-time audio input and
output for Pd \, respectively \, whether analog or digital.;
#X text 102 515 - Dave Sabine \, May 5 \, 2003;
#X text 104 83 Both of these objects accept arguments (numbers) which
indicate which audio channels are to be used by Pd. By default \, these
objects are stereo and communicate on audio channels 1 and 2 (left
and right respectively) but by using arguments \, other channel numbers
can be specified. These objects can communicate with hundreds of audio
channels \, but you are likely limited by your audio hardware to 2
\, 4 \, 6 \, 8 \, 12 \, 16 \, 32 \, 64 \, etc.;

#X text 107 345 The actual number of Pd inputs and outputs are set
on Pd's command line. You can open patches that want to use more channels
\, but channel numbers that out of range will be dropped by [dac~]
or appears as zero by [adc~].;
#X text 14 344 IMPORTANT:;
#X text 108 419 Also \, these objects do not operate unless Pd is instructed
to "Compute Audio".;
