hi, these objects were created in hopes of making the pd gui 'suck less'

you need ToXY to use them: 
cvs -d :pserver:anonymous@cvs.sf.net:/cvsroot/pure-data co externals/miXed
cd externals/miXed && make && mv bin/* /usr/lib/pd/extra

and loads of tk libraries, most are in portage, or try this:
cvs -d :pserver:anonymous@cvs.sf.net:/cvsroot/blt
cd blt && ./configure && make && make install


to use a file called 'crack.wid' youd make an object [widget crack rock1] where 
you pick an id..

misc notes (april 2005):
tk is ugly without Cairo graphics (linux only), apply the patch, then 
./configure --enable-xft --enable-cairo

tkdnd is broken on linux with tk 8.5, unless you patch tkEvent.c
