<h1>Pure Data External Repository</h1>
<!-- Quote of the day -->
<p class="small"><br>
I think it is certainly true that the open-source movement is a very powerful
source toward higher-quality software, and I would turn the question around and
ask if open-source music wouldn t also be a very good thing.

<h2>Introduction</h2>

The Pure Data external repository is meant to be a place where developers of
externals for the Pure Data computer music system can put their code. For
information about PD, look at the <A HREF="http://www.pure-data.org">Pure Data
website</A>.
<p>

PD has a huge user base and we all enjoy working with PD. A lot of externals
are being written and published on the web. As a consequence, it has become
increasingly hard to have an overview of all the externals. A central code
repository will offer this, as well as many other advantages. It will be easier
to manage the code, update orphaned externals, distribute compiled versions for
different systems, avoid duplication of effort, collaborate on improving the
same external, and finally the users have the advantage of being able to
download it from one single place.
<p>

I could go on listing the advantages, but there is one big disadvantage. We
have to work on it in order to make it a success. We have to learn CVS and we
have to import our projects into the repository. I think it is worth this work,
because you gain a lot too. If you don´t have the time to get into this, but
still agree that your external becomes part of the repository, just <A
HREF="mailto:geiger@xdv.org">send an email </A> with the information how to
download your code.
<p>

Another drawback is that your code has to be GPL'd. If this is a problem for
you, let <a href="mailto:pd-dev@iem.kug.ac.at">us</a> know.

<h2>Projects at the Pure Data Repository</h2>
There is a list with short descriptions of the <a
href="subprojects.html">Externals currently in the Repository</a>

<h2>Accessing the Externals via CVS</h2>

You have to install cvs. On most Linux systems this is already installed, on
Windows or Mac OS/X you will have to download it <A
HREF="http://cvsgui.sourceforge.net/">from the net</A>.  Then, if you have cvs
installed (this example is assuming the commandline version) use the following
line to login into the CVS server:
<pre>
% cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.pure-data.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/pure-data login 
</pre> 
<p>

Hit return when you are asked for a password.  In order to get the source:
<pre>
% cvs -z3 -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.pure-data.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/pure-data co externals
</pre>
<p>

This will give you a local copy of the externals-directory in the repository.
After some time, if you want to get all the latest additions and updates, type
(in the externals directory):
<pre>
% cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.pure-data.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/pure-data update -d
</pre>
<p>

Without the -d only existing directories on your local copy get updated. 
<p>

Currently building the externals works to same way it did before, just cd into
the external directory (e.g. cd vst) and read through the compilation
instructions.  Later this process will be automated and you can build al the
externals in one go, or even download a precompiled archive for your system.
<p>
Some other modules in the repository include Pd abstractions or the developers
version of Pd. You can check these out by replacing the modulename with the
respective modulename.
<p>
For example check out the abstractions with:
<pre>
% cvs -z3 -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.pure-data.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/pure-data co abstractions
</pre>
<p>
or Pd with 

<pre>
% cvs -z3 -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.pure-data.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/pure-data co pd
</pre>
<p>
To check out the current developers' branch, which is tagged with &quot;devel_0_36&quot;, use 
<pre>
% cvs -z3 -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.pure-data.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/pure-data co -r devel_0_36 pd
</pre>
<p>
You can find out the available branches in the pulldown menu on the project's
<a href="http://cvs.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/pure-data/pd/">CVS-page</a>
(or use "cvs -T ..."). 
<a href="http://cvs.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/pure-data/">Browsing CVS</a>
is a good way to see what else is in the repository anyway.
<p>
If you absoluetly cannot use CVS, there are <a href="http://cvs.sourceforge.net/cvstarballs/pure-data-cvsroot.tar.gz">nightly CVS-tarballs</a> 
of the whole project tree available (around 15 MB currently).
<h2>Putting Your Externals in the Repository</h2>

This description is mainly about Linux, if you are working with Windows, you
might try the procedure described in this <a
href="http://sfsetup.sourceforge.net/tutorial_cvsaccess.html">tutorial</a>. Let
us know if it works.
<p>

To contribute your pd externals to the repository you'll first have to register
yourself at sourceforge (making you an official developer of the project). Go
to sourceforge.net and click on the "new user" link on the upper left corner.
Then <A HREF="mailto:geiger@xdv.org">send an email </A> with the user you
created and Guenter will add you to the pure-data developer list.
<p>

At the <A HREF="HTTP://sourceforge.net/projects/pure-data">project page</A> you
can see if you are already listed as a developer. The next step is to "import"
your source code. First make sure that your code is in a directory, and remove
everything from that directory that you don´t want to put under CVS.  Compiled
code, for example, is not normally put into CVS. 
<p>

Make sure you are in this directory and issue the command:
<p>
<pre>
% export CVS_RSH=ssh
% cvs -z3 -d:ext: developername@cvs.pure-data.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/pure-data 
  import externals/dirname developername source-dist
</pre>
<p>

Exchange "developername" with your sourceforge accountname and "dirname" with
the  name of your  externals directory.  You have to import the source only
once for your external(s).
<p>

If all of this went well, move away your external directory (keep it as a
backup) and checkout the code with:
<pre>
% cvs -z3 -d:ext:developername@cvs.pure-data.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/pure-data 
  co externals
</pre>
<p>

From this point on, if you are working in your externals directory, and want to
commit your changes to the server you just have to do
<pre>
% cvs commit
</pre>
<p>

or 
<pre>
% cvs update
</pre>
<p>

to take a look at what you have changed.
<p>

All the information about where the repository is, the loginname etc, is in the
"CVS" directory, that should be part of your external directory now.
<p>

If you are still unsure about the workings, take a look at this <a
href="http://www.cvshome.org/docs/blandy.html">introduction</A> about using
CVS.

<h2>Contact</h2>

All questions, suggestions should go to the <a href="mailto:pd-dev@iem.kug.ac.at">PD Developer 
mailing list</a>.  (Except if you want to ask to be added to the developer list on sourceforge).
