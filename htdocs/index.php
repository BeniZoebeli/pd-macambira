<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>The Pure Data external repository is meant to be a place where developers of
externals for the Pure Data computer music system can put their code. For
information about PD, look at the <A HREF="http://www.pure-data.org">Pure Data
website</A>.</p>


<p>PD has a huge user base and we all enjoy working with PD. A lot of externals
are being written and published on the web. As a consequence, it has become
increasingly hard to have an overview of all the externals. A central code
repository will offer this, as well as many other advantages. It will be easier
to manage the code, update orphaned externals, distribute compiled versions for
different systems, avoid duplication of effort, collaborate on improving the
same external, and finally the users have the advantage of being able to
download it from one single place.</p>


<p>I could go on listing the advantages, but there is one big disadvantage. We
have to work on it in order to make it a success. We have to learn CVS and we
have to import our projects into the repository. I think it is worth this work,
because you gain a lot too. If you don´t have the time to get into this, but
still agree that your external becomes part of the repository, just <A
HREF="mailto:geiger@xdv.org">send an email </A> with the information how to
download your code.</p>

<p>A lot of the externals here are currently GPL'd, but the only requirement we have is, that
you code has an Open Source license.
