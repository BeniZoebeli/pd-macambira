      <h4>pd-list</h4><ul>
	  <li>This is the official mailinglist for the Pd-community.</li>
	  <li>Most of the things regarding pure-data are discussed on this list.
	    However, for pure off-topic items, announcements or developers' talk,
	    the appropriate mailing-lists (see below) should be used.</li>
	  <li>For subscription/unsubscription and delivery options, please visit the web-interface at
	    <a href="http://iem.kug.ac.at/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/pd-list">

	</ul>
      <h4>pd-dev</h4><ul>
	  <li>There is a <b>developer</b>-list for discussion of hacking pure-data and externals and similar.
	    Since Pd is still beta software (this is: needs some testing), it is a good idea to subscribe
	    to this list too.</li>
	  <li>It is probably a good idea, to subscribe to this list too,
	    since developers threads on the main list will eventually be moved to this list
	    (by users, not by the administrator)</li>
	  <li>For subscription/unsubscription and delivery options, please visit the web-interface at
	    <a href="http://iem.kug.ac.at/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/pd-dev">

	</ul>
      <h4>off-topic</h4><ul>
	  <li>This list is intended to be a forum for the Pd-community that allows 
	    the discussion of things apart from pure-data.</li>
	  <li>It is probably a good idea, to subscribe to this list too,
	    since off-topic threads on the main list will eventually be moved to this list
	    (by users, not by the administrator)</li>
	  <li>For subscription/unsubscription and delivery options, please visit the web-interface at
	    <a href="http://iem.kug.ac.at/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/pd-ot">

	</ul>
      <h4>pd-announce</h4><ul>
	  <li>There is an <b>announce</b>-list for announcements regarding Pd-releases,
	    software releases (like externals), upcoming events, concerts, ...</li>
	  <li>This list might prove most interesting for people not having the time and intention
	    to keep-up with the main-lists but still want to stay up-to-date.</li>
	  <li>For subscription/unsubscription and delivery options, please visit the web-interface at
