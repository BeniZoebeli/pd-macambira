k_sc~ v0.0.1


k_sc~ requires you to use Jack as the audio API for PD.
It is an external that automaticly routes the audio
between PD and the Supercollider synth.

It provides two objects:

1. [from_sc~] Receives sound from Supercollider.
   Syntax is the same as the [adc~] object.

2. [to_sc~] Sends sound to Supercollider.
   Syntax is the same as the [dac~] object.
