INSTALL

do './configure --help'   to see options


  --disable-flext-shared   build with flext compiled in statically, not the best idea
  --with-pd-dir=path       pd header path (default=/usr/local/include)
  --with-flext-dir=path    flext headers path (default=/usr/local/lib/pd/flext)
  --with-flext-sys=<N>     1 for Max/Msp, 2 for PD (default=2)



then do something like './confugure --bindir=/usr/local/lib/pd/extra'
and then 'make'
and then 'make install'



if you assign a --bindir, it will install the readansf~.pd_*   external there.


afterwards, a 'make uninstall' will also properly remove the readanysf~.pd_* external
