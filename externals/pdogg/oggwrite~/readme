oggwrite~ version 0.1b
copyright (c) 2002 by Olaf Matthes

oggwrite~ is an ogg/vorbis file writing external for pd (by Miller 
Puckette).


To run oggwrite~ place the file oggwrite~.dll for win or oggwrite~.pd_linux 
in the directory of our patch or start pd with '-lib oggwrite~' flag. 

To compile oggwrite~ on Linux get the ogg/vorbice library from 
http://www.vorbis.com/.
You have to modify the makefile to make it point to the place where the
ogg/vorbis library is.

Usage:

Use message "vbr <samplerate> <channels> <quality>" to set the vorbis
encoding parameters. Resampling is currently not supported, so 'samplerate' 
should be the one pd is running at. 'channels' specyfies the number of channels 
to stream. This can be set to 2 (default) or 1 which means mono stream taking
the leftmost audio input only. 'quality' can be a value between 0.0 and 1.0 
giving the quality of the stream. 0.4 (default) results in a stream that's 
about 128kbps. 

Since Vorbis uses VBR encoding, bitrates vary depending on the type of audio
signal to be encoded. A pure sine [osc~] results in the smalest stream, com-
plex audio signals will increase this value significantly. To test the maximum 
bitrate that might occur for a quality setting use noise~ as signal input.

Use message "vorbis <samplerate> <channels> <maximum bitrate> <nominal bit-
rate> <minimal bitrate>" to set encoding quality on the basis of bitrates.
When setting all three bitrate parameters to the same value one gets a
constant bitrate stream. Values are in kbps!

Message "open <filename>" opens an existing file. In case the file does not
exist oggwrite~ will create it. Previously opened files will be closed. To
determine how data should be written to the file choose "append" (default) 
or "truncate" (in case you want to overwrite data in your file).

To set the comment tags in the ogg/vorbis header (which can be displayed by
the receiving client) use message "<NAMEOFTAG> <comment>". Supported tags are:
TITLE, ARTIST, GENRE, PERFORMER, LOCATION, COPYRIGHT, CONTACT, DESCRIPTION and
DATE (which is automatically set to the date/time the broadcast started). To
get spaces use '=' instead.

Note that changing encoding parameters or header comments while oggwrite~ is
recording to file might result in audible dropouts.


Listening to it:

To listen to ogg/vorbis encoded audio files many player need an extra plug-in.
Have a look at http://www.vorbis.com/ to find the appropiate plug-in for your
player.
