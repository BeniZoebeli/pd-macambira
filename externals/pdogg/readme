pdogg~ is a collection of ogg/vorbis externals for pd (by Miller 
Puckette).

It includes:
- oggamp~   : streaming client
- oggcast~  : streamer (for Icecast2)
- oggread~  : reads files from disk
- oggwrite~ : writes files to disk


To use pdogg~ start pd with '-lib path\to\pdogg' flag. 
On Win32 systems Pd 0.35 test 17 or later is necessary to get it working!

To compile pdogg~ you need the ogg/vorbice library from 
http://www.vorbis.com/ and under win additionally Pthreads-win32 from
http://sources.redhat.com/pthreads-win32/.
You have to modify the makefile to make it point to the place where the
libraries can be found on your system.
