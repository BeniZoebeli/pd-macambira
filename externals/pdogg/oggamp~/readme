oggamp~ is an ogg/vorbis streaming client external for pd (by Miller 
Puckette) that connects to an IceCast2 server.
Graphical buffer status display written by Yves Degoyon (ydegoyon@free.fr).


To run oggamp~ place the file oggamp~.dll for win or oggamp~.pd_linux 
in the directory of our patch or start pd with '-lib oggamp~' flag. 

To compile oggamp~ on Linux get the ogg/vorbice library from 
http://www.vorbis.com/.
You have to modify the makefile to make it point to the place where the
ogg/vorbis library is.

Usage:

To run oggamp~ innormal mode, just use [oggamp~] or, to get the buffer status
displayed, use [oggamp~ 1].

Message "connect <host> <mountpoint> <port>" connects to an IceCast2 server.
Note that no response about succesfull connection is send by the server. All
messages in the pd console window about connection status depend on the ability
to receive data from the server.
Use "connecturl <url>" to use url-like server adresses (like http://host:post/
stream.ogg).

Known bugs and other things:
- pd halts for a moment when oggamp~ connects to the server. This results in a
  short audio drop out of sound currently played back.
- resampling not jet supported
- playback does not stop on a buffer underrun
- oggamp~ disconnects at end of stream, i.e. it is not possible to play back
  files streamed one after another without manual reconnect
