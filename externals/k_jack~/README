k_jack~ - General signal in/out external for pure data. Kjetil S. Matheussen.
V0.0.2


This external makes objects with signal inlets and outlets to jack ports. See
the help patch.

It works by calling functions and using variables in pd/src/s_audio.c that probably
was not ment to be used for this purpose. But it works. And thats whats important.
