GNU/Linux

(actually only tested in GNU/Linux Ubuntu Gutsy)

unpack it ::

cd into the library folder ::

cd pix_opencv

or

cd pdp_opencv

edit the Makefile to fit your system and sources folders:

for pix_opencv edit the Makefile and change the values for PD_DIR and GEM_DIR variables

for pix_opencv edit the Makefile and change the values for PD_DIR and PDP_DIR variables

then, compile it ::

make clean
make

and copy the .pd_linux to your externals folder ::

cp *.pd_linux /usr/local/lib/pd/extra/

MAC OSX (macintel)

(This is only for pix_opencv Actually still there isnâ€™t a MACOSX makefile for pdp_opencv.)

cd pix_opencv

Overwrite the Makefile with this one : Makefile.darwin

edit the Makefile and change the values for PD_DIR and GEM_DIR variables
and edit this lines : OPENCV_CFLAGS and OPENCV_LIBS
Put something like that -I/opt/local/var/macports/software/opencv/1.0.0_0/opt/local/include/opencv/ and -L/opt/local/var/macports/software/opencv/1.0.0_0/opt/local/lib/ -lcxcore -lcv -lhighgui -lcvaux -lml 

then, compile it ::

make clean
make

and copy the .pd_darwin to your externals folder ::

cp *.pd_darwin /Applications/Pd-0.40.3-extended-20080315.app/Contents/Resources/extra/
