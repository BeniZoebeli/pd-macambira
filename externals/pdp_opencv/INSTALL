GNU/Linux

(actually only tested in GNU/Linux Ubuntu Gutsy)

first install opencv development packages,
on ubuntu :

apt-get install libcv-dev
apt-get install libcvaux-dev
apt-get install libhighgui-dev


then get the _SOURCES_ of the pd you are using
and of the GEM or PDP that you are loading
( it might not work if the version 
is different )

then compile the externals :

cd pix_opencv

or

cd pdp_opencv

edit the Makefile to fit your pd and GEM/PDP sources paths :

for pix_opencv edit the Makefile and change the values for PD_DIR and GEM_DIR variables

for pix_opencv edit the Makefile and change the values for PD_DIR and PDP_DIR variables

then, compile it ::

make clean
make

and copy the .pd_linux to your externals folder ::

cp *.pd_linux /usr/local/lib/pd/extra/
