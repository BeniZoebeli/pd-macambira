msd2d-editor
------------

patched by Frank Barknecht <fbar@footils.org> with a big hand from Nicolas
Montgermont <montgermont@la-kitchen.fr> who wrote the msd2D external required
for using this patch. GEM is used to provide an alternative visualization, but
it is not required for the patch to work. 
Thanks Nicolas for a great external colletion.

msd2d-editor.pd is the patch to open, further documentation is inside.
