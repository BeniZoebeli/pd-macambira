first, install  :

imlib2 ( http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=2 )
Image Magick ( http://www.imagemagick.org ) 
 ---->  watchout !! configure with --enable-shared 
and ffmpeg 
 ----> watchout, it requires the cvs snapshot ! : http://ffmpeg.sourceforge.net/cvs
 + don't forget to activate mp3 and vorbis support in ffmpeg : ./configure --enable-mp3lame --enable-vorbis

you should also have installed libquicktime that is necessary for PDP 
( http://sourceforge.net/projects/libquicktime ).

gone through it ?? yeh, i know it's a lot.
ok, first stage reached )

fix PD, PDP and FFMPEG paths in configure.ac

autoconf 

./configure 

make clean 

make

as root, make install

pidip is a library, it should be loaded
with the "-lib <path>/pidip" command line option
but, BEWARE, it should be place AFTER the 
loading of PDP library ( option "-lib <path>/pdp" )

Enjoy!!

Thanx for getting here.
