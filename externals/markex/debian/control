Description: a library Pd of misc objects from Mark Danks
 Markex is an external library of miscellaneous objects that was begun in 1994
 and originally included in GEM.  It is largely here for the sake of old
 projects that might still rely on it.  The included functionality has been
 improved in other libraries.
