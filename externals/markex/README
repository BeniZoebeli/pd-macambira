------------------------------
  GEM and MARKEX
------------------------------

These are objects from GEM which don't have any dependencies besides libc.
What is here is the entire contents of Gem/src/MarkEx except [hsv2rsb] and
the vector lib.  Hopefully they will be removed from Gem once they become a
proper part of this repository.


------------------------------
  CONFLICTS
------------------------------

These objects have name conflicts with other objects/libs therefore:

Name       Conflicts with
-----------------------------------
[average]   (maxlib)
[counter]   (cxc,cyclone)
[change]    (pd)

Since these names have all been taken, these objects have been renamed by
adding "gem_" before the original name.


------------------------------
  OMISSIONS
------------------------------

[reson~] has been left out since it is now part of cxc.
[abs~] has been left out since its now part of creb.
