this ist ext13, a collection of externals for pd
most of the code comes from other pd-object or externals
and is just modifyed. 
you can use, copy modify, distribute... blahblah
there`s no warranty for anything.


--------compile------------
ext13 is developed and tested in linux.
if you need it for another platform, you have to do the work to port it
to compile it do  
./configure
or ./configure --prefix=/usr/lib (or similar) for a path other than /usr/local
make


to get a seperate externalfile (.pd_linux) for every external, or

./configure
make clean
make ext13
to get a single library for all externals.

make install 
will put the externals in /path/to/pd/externs/
and the helpfiles in /path/to/pd/doc/5.manual/


don`t forget to put the files in your pd-path or do a 
-lib /path/to/ext13
to be able to use it.
