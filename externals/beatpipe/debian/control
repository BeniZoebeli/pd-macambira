Description: a realtime scheduler/event-delay/quantizer object for Pd
 This object is a realtime scheduler, event-delay, and quantizer object for
 Pure Data.  It is used for making beats and other rhythmic sequences. Any
 list starting with a number T sent to the left inlet, will be sent to the
 output after T beats, quantized with tpq (tick per quarter) and stripped of
 the leading beat number. The tempo can be changed dynamically on the right
 inlet The quantification can be set at any time with a set-tpq message.
