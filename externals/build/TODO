- incorporate %.c building into cross-platform Makefile, and have it work with
  subdirectories so that libdirs can be compiled here.

- simplify Makefile, making just "all" and "install" with subsections for each
  subdir.

- get externals/build/src/prepend.c to compile in Pd mode, which means it will
  have a right inlet when created without an argument

- add in mtx_ objects with special characters using setup functions and
  filenames with 0x escapes (mtx_/ and mtx_./ for example).  Make sure to have
  the objects call the correct setup function since it can change the
  functionality

- fix compilation of netclient, netrec, netserver, piperead~, pipewrite~

- include mp3 externals from iem_mp3 and unauthorized and make mp3*.libs files

- put objects with conflicting names into a directory namespace

  		maxlib/scale
		Gem/scale
		iem/prepend
		cxc/prepend
		flext/prepend

- move .libs files to externals/build/src from externals/build/PLATFORM.  The
  platform-specific makefiles copy them before compiling.  If a
  platform-specific .libs file is needed, create it in the
  externals/build/PLATFORM directory.  The makefiles will use both:
  `test -f $*.libs && cat $*.libs` `test -f ../src/$*.libs && cat ../src/$*.libs`

- add these to the build system:
      PDContainer
      ann
		grh
		iemstream
		iemxmlrpc
