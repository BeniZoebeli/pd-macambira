- document smlib building 

- add "test lib" functionality to binary building in externals/Makefile

- simplify Makefile, making just "all" and "install" with subsections for each
  subdir.

- get externals/build/src/prepend.c to compile in Pd mode, which means it will
  have a right inlet when created without an argument (because of cyclone's
  buld system, its quite difficult to do.  I think it should just be removed
  from default)

- add in mtx_ objects with special characters using setup functions and
  filenames with 0x escapes (mtx_/ and mtx_./ for example).  Make sure to have
  the objects call the correct setup function since it can change the
  functionality

- fix compilation of netclient, netrec, netserver, piperead~, pipewrite~

- include mp3 externals from iem_mp3 and unauthorized and make mp3*.libs files

- put objects with conflicting names into a directory namespace

  		maxlib/scale
		Gem/scale
		iem/prepend
		cxc/prepend
		flext/prepend

- add these to the build system:
      PDContainer
      ann
		grh
		iemstream
		iemxmlrpc
