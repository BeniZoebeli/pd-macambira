PD externals build system
=========================

To build, cd to the platform directory:

cd linux
cd win
cd darwin
cd irix

and type make.





Build System Internals
======================

The build system is actually on top of the  different externals packages
that are in the CVS.

Every external (the source code) is linked into the "src" directory.
In order to be platform independent this is done via c-includes.

Then the build system just tries to build every exeternal that it 
finds in "src".

Problems with this approach:
- it can't be applied to externals that use additional libraries.
- it might be hard for externals that use several source files
  (not always, look at src/ann.c)
