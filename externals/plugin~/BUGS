- Linium avez écrit: "The output of syndrum and organ is a curious uncontrallable
  screaming noise that can resist a multipliy by 0. Some sort of bytes flow...
  It seems that the audio output spits something which is not an audio signal and
  even confuses PD."  A bug in plugin~ or what?

VST
---
- plugin~ doesn't support VST 2.0 synthesizer plug-ins.
- Additionally, the VST 1.0 plug-ins are required to implement the
  processReplacing() interface in order for them to work with plugin~.
  You will get an error message if this is not the case.
- Furthermore, no graphics is displayed for the plug-ins; I am
  helplessly waiting for someone to volunteer to add VST GUI support.
- Also, plugin~ should observe the Windows registry
  (HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\VST\VSTPluginsPath) for the VST plug-in
  path.
