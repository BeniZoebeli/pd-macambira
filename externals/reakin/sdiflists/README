PURPOSE:
This is an external for the computer music application Pure Data.
Its purpose is to allow the use of SDIF analysis data within pd. 
SDIF is a file format for data exchange between programs, you 
can find more info about it at http://www.ircam.fr/sdif or
http://archive.cnmat.berkeley.edu/SDIF/ .  I specifically use it 
for resynthesizing sinusoidal tracks in pd... look for Trax on my
webpage to get all the components for that.  

INSTALL:
You first need to download and install Ircam's SDIF library.  There are 
many different versions to be found on the net, I am using the latest
Sourceforge version found at http://sourceforge.net/projects/sdif. Last
time I tried, I could not get it to compile on windows, so if you want this
on that platform you have to get it to compile and adjust the makefile.

in this directory do
     (for linux)
  make pd_linux 
or (for mac)
  make pd_darwin

HOW TO USE:
[sdiflists] will only handle one stream per sdif file; if you do not declare
which stream you want you will get the first in the file by default.  All
matrices within that frame will be available for output.  The number of
outlets is declared as an argument to the externals, e.g. [sdiflists 6] 
would make 6 outlets that output analysis data, one for each column.
So if you have 2 matrices of 4 columns each, you will get all of the first
matrix and the first 2 columns of the second.  There is also an outlet 
for time and for info such as 1NVT tables and other useful things.
For syntax detais, see sdiflists-help.pd.

BUGS or SUGGESTIONS:
There are a couple known bugs (you may notice warnings of the 
wrong frametype in the terminal, haven't figured out why yet) and
a couple work-arounds in the code.  But please let me know what
you find when using this external, if you can fix it then great.  As I
mentioned above, so far I only use this external for sinusoidal
synthesis so I do not know if frametypes other than 1TRC or
1STF will cause problems. I have tried to check, but.. you know.

TODO:
- make an external for writing sdif files.. hopefully people have
suggestions for doing this because it is a little trickier than
outputting lists like [sdiflists]

THANKYOUS:
Thanks to Tom Erbe for all the programming tips throughout my
stay at UCSD.  Thanks to Miller Puckette for helping me figure
out the odds and ends of Pd.  Thanks to Shlomo Dubnov for
introducing me to and sharing knowledge about Sound Descr-
tors.  Finally thanks to those on the SDIF and Pd mailing lists
for helping cure me of ignorance.  Sorry though, still a long way
to go!
