------------------------------------------------------------------

This external pd library is a framework for image/video processing (and 
other raw data packets) that is fast, simple and flexible and as much 
as possible compatible with the pd messaging system.

Unfortunately, since the main idea is to "have something for myself to 
play with", i haven't payed much attention to portability or even  
compilablility yet. So if some of the requirements are missing on your 
system, you'll have to tinker a bit to get it working until i move to 
automatic configuration and building...

Features:

* packet formats: greyscale and YV12 encoded images,
  binary cellular automata (CA)
* sources: noise, video4linux and quicktime (with audio), CA
* sink: xvideo display
* filters: convolution, biquad time, biquad space, CA
* warping: rotate, zoom, stretch
* transforms: colour translation/scaling, grey->palette
* add, mul, mix, random pixel mix
* utility objs: packet register, snapshot, trigger
* packet delay line
* minimal forth system for defining CA rules (only for mmx)


Implementation:

* mmx/c 16bit internal integer processing
* sort of cache optimized (locality + minimal memory usage)


Requirements:

* pd
* linux
* a video4linux device for video input. special support for 
philips webcam included.
* libquicktime (not quicktime4linux!) for quicktime playback.
* an X display with XVideo extension for video display
* libsdl


Documentation:

Have a look in doc/ for documentation. The file doc/reference.txt 
contains a list of all objects. doc/introduction has some basic
facts on using pdp. doc/objects is a reference doc for all the
objects and doc/examples contains some more example patches.

The directory abstractions/ has some abstractions using the pdp 
objects (some specific filters) that can serve as example.

For developer docs see modules/README, scaf/README. 


Building:

Edit Makefile.config to reflect your system settings. For now this 
should be the pd dir, the pdp dir, a toggle for philips web cam 
support and the compilation target (linux / linux_mmx). 
type "make" in the top directory. Remember to type 
"make clean all" after editing Makefile.config


Using:

launch pd with the options -lib $PDP_DIR/pdp -path $PDP_DIR/abstractions


Bugs:

see the TODO file


Additional Remarks: 

* If some of the modules don't compile due to some missing libraries, 
you can try to comment out the offending code in modules/Makefile and 
system/pdp.c If compilation or linking fails due to other reasons, 
please let me know. If you have both libquicktime and quicktime4linux
installed, make sure pdp.pd_linux loads the right library.

* The reason i use YV12 and not RGB is simple: it's faster, and for 
linear operations it doesn't make much difference. Most camera's and
codecs use a luma/chroma system, and most video cards support hardware
accellerated display. Note that in YUV, the u (Cb) and v (Cr) components 
can be negative, so saturation after multiplication with a positive 
(or negative) value produces not only black and white, but also red, 
green, blue and their complements. In short, in YUV, nonlinear operations 
have a different effect than in RGB. Another thing: all the spatial 
operations are not implemented "correctly" because of the subsampling 
involved.

* The image packets are 16bit/component planar. This is to simplify 
the mmx code and to have a little more headroom and precision for 
processing. 

* Packets can be processed in a low priority thread with a dropping 
mechanism to prevent overload or audio drops, or they can be processed 
in the main pd thread. This can be set/unset by sending a "thread x"
message to pdp_control. Processing in pdp thread is off by default.
Use the pd thread for rock solid video timing. Increase the audio 
latency to avoid dropouts. If you want low audio latency, and don't
care about a dropped video frame here and there, switch on the pdp
thread. Note that when using the pdp thread, the control flow is no
longer depth first. Additinal delays will be introduced.

* There have been some requests for an osx port, but i wil probably not
do this myself (at least not right now). However, i've ported all
the mmx code to c, so it should work on other architectures as well.
This should ease porting a bit for anyone who wants to give it a try. 
Also i've moved all the image conversion routines to pdp_llconv.c  
This means porting is reduced to writing new objects for the os specific 
stuff like movie playback&record and live video input. Thanks to Martin
Pi we now have sdl support for video output.

* Have a look at Yves Degoyon's PiDiP library. It contains some extra 
effects (from EffecTV and FreeJ), a quicktime recording object, some 
streaming modules, ... (the list is growing rapidly ;) see
http://ydegoyon.free.fr/

* Some quicktime remarks: pdp_qt~ is still a bit experimental, you might 
try pdp_yqt in yves' lib to see if it works better for you. Also, it 
seems that libquicktime does not work with compressed headers. The 
suggested codec is jpeg (photo) and uncompressed audio with the same 
samplerate as the one pd is using. (hint: compile libquicktime with
mmx jpeg support)

* The cellular automata object (pdp_ca) is now moved to a separate lib.
It requires mmx to be compiled. see the scaf/ dir.

* New versions of this package can be found at

Experimental relases are in the subdirectory test/
