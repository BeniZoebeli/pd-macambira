bugs:

* some image dimensions cause crashes: solution: add checks in sources (pdp_v4l / pdp_qt / pdp_ca)
(workaround: use a multiple of 8x8 to prevent this. ca dims should be a multiple of 64x2)
* pdp_xv: catch sigpipe when window is closed (workaround: don't close the video windows manually ;)

todo 0.8:
* rotate
* crop, shift (pad+scroll)
* efficient rescalers: pdp_double pdp_halve
* move float color conversion and float<->fixed point conv code to system
* thresholding / color "waveshaping"
* documentation (+cleanup)

todo:

* add audio resampling in pdp_qt~
* clean up and add some ca rules
* add some more abstractions to have faster acces to different modes of all the modules
* fix dimension problems on input (for now, make sure images have correct dim, else generate error)
* use pd_error instead of post for errors
* finish documentation
* add developer documentation
* move to autoconf/automake/libtool
* interface with gem
* think about the memory allocation strategy (there is no garbage collection right now)
* add general x window display code (hmm, this is more hassle than i thought..)

wish list:
* colour keying
* camera controller (motion tracking ?)
