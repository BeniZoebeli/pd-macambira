known bugs:

* running out of memory (using delay lines or loops) will likely crash pd. 
short story: don't, use pdp_control's memlimit for limiting pdp's memory usage.
* no known other fatal (crashing) bugs. please let me know if you find one.



todo 0.13:

* add source type to source objects (noise,plasma,constant,...)
* pdp_crop/pad
* seed plasma
* reorganize headers to cut down compile time
* fullscreen x command -> add window manager suppression
* where to solve autoconvert? per type, or central in pdp_base? 2 cases:
- template based autoconvert: in pdp_base
- compatibility based autoconvert: i.e. pdp_add (solve in base: move_passive)
* finish high level packet conversion:
- move 8bit images to packet level (iow: cleanup pdp_qt, pdp_v4l, pdp_xv)
- add bitmap packet support to source modules (optim for pdp_opengl usage)
- get rid of pdp_type* methods
* fix mac/linux name differences (use pdp_video, pdp_movie, pdp_window)
* pdp_xv framerate doc + pwc addons

todo 0.14:

* stress test the memory manager. it looks like there's a bug that pops up after running for a while
* image packet -> sound: interpret as sonogram: intensity = magnitude, colour = phase
* enable audio output on bttv cards in pdp_v4l
* fix cache slicer objects + thread problems (add slice objects to forth)
* derive as much classes as possible from pdp_base class (part of module code reorg)
* displacement warp, substitution warp, refraction warp, timespace warp, wormhole warp
* check the use of varargs for image processing dispatching routine
* more scopes
* 2D affine transforms parametrized by vectors (center, x-axis, y-axis) (np1 + matrix processing objects)
* some abstractions around pdp_cheby (colour shape, ...)
* thresholding (abstraction using pdp_cheby?) + absolute value object
* efficient rescalers: pdp_double pdp_halve
* move float color conversion and float<->fixed point conv code to system
* crop, shift (pad+scroll)
* solve biquad (blur) mmx boundary init prob (bands at edges: solve with proper init?)
* optimize blur effect (1 pole ? / dependency stalls)
* jpeg/png packet and streaming support (pdp_netsend / pdp_netreceive : binary compat issues!!)
* find out why resampling code (warping) is so slow (reg->mem->reg->mem stalls?)
* mmx profiling
* add audio resampling in pdp_qt~
* use pd_error instead of post for errors
* ascii art packet processors
* 3D time space interpolation
* colour keying
* motion tracking
* moebius transforms
* type multiplexing: find a way to use the same name for packet processors. (-> forth)
i.e. pdp_add should add images, but also vectors, ascii packets, textures,...
