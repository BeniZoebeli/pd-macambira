bugs:

* some image dimensions cause crashes: solution: add checks in sources (pdp_v4l / pdp_qt / pdp_ca)
(workaround: use a multiple of 8x8 to prevent this. ca dims should be a multiple of 64x2)
* pdp_xv: catch sigpipe when window is closed (workaround: don't close the video windows manually ;)

todo 0.9:

* improve scanned synthesis (method to specify scanning path)
* solve image dimension problenms for sources
* ascii art packet stuff (yves?)
* add real trigger object (problem with 3 phase protocol ?)
* add shear -> simplify code to use general affine 2d transformations
* displacement warp, substitution warp
* efficient rescalers: pdp_double pdp_halve
* move float color conversion and float<->fixed point conv code to system
* add mouse pointer code to pdp_xv
* crop, shift (pad+scroll)

todo:

* thresholding
* find out why resampling code (warping) is so slow (reg->mem->reg->mem stalls?)
* add audio resampling in pdp_qt~
* add some more abstractions
* fix dimension problems on input (for now, make sure images have correct dim, else generate error)
* use pd_error instead of post for errors
* move to autoconf/automake/libtool
* interface with gem
* think about the memory allocation strategy (there is no garbage collection right now)

wish list:

* colour keying
* camera controller (motion tracking ?)
* moebius transforms  (integer inverse square root??) & other complex plane stuff
