fatal crash bugs:

* none that i know of (if pdp dies on you, please let me know)


todo 0.9:

* 2D affine transforms parametrized by vectors (center, x-axis, y-axis)
* some abstractions around pdp_cheby (colour shape, ...)
* add real trigger object (problem with 3 phase protocol ?)
* absolute value object
* displacement warp, substitution warp
* efficient rescalers: pdp_double pdp_halve
* move float color conversion and float<->fixed point conv code to system
* crop, shift (pad+scroll)

todo 0.10:

* solve biquad (blur) boundary init prob
* optimize blur effect (1 pole ? / dependency stalls)
* jpeg/png file and streaming support?
* thresholding
* find out why resampling code (warping) is so slow (reg->mem->reg->mem stalls?)
* mmx profiling
* add audio resampling in pdp_qt~
* use pd_error instead of post for errors
* interface with gem
* think about the memory allocation strategy (there is no garbage collection right now)
* add automatic pwc detection
* frame rate limited delay line (burst delay?)

wish list:

* ascii art packet stuff (yves?)
* 3D time space interpolation
* colour keying
* camera controller (motion tracking ?)
* moebius transforms  (integer inverse square root??) & other complex plane stuff
