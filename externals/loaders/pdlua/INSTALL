Compiling
=========

Dynamic
-------

The default Makefile uses the Lua provided by your system, which makes 
the Lua external smaller.  You need to install Lua 5.1 via your system's 
usual method, whether Apt or Yum or Fink or whatever.

Unfortunately various systems have different locations for Lua files, 
and even different names, which makes this difficult.  If you have any 
problems, try the Static variant that follows.

For Linux:
cd src && make lua.pd_linux

For OS X:
cd src && make lua.pd_darwin


Static
------

Lua can be linked statically into the Lua external.  Download:

http://www.lua.org/ftp/lua-5.1.2.tar.gz

and unpack it to a directory "src/lua-5.1.2".

Then you need to compile Lua and the Lua external:

For Linux:
cd src/lua-5.1.2 && make linux local &&
cd .. && make -f Makefile.static lua.pd_linux

For OS X:
cd src/lua-5.1.2 && make macosx local &&
cd .. && make -f Makefile.static lua.pd_darwin


Installing
==========

No special installation required, just make sure Pd can find 
lua.pd_linux (or equivalent for your OS) and pd.lua in its path.

A simple way to do this is to copy both files to ".../lib/pd/extra/".
