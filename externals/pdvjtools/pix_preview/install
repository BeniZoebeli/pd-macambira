first, install gem and pd sources (if you don't have them)

you will need libtk-img also 

Use the configure script and specify the directories:
e.g.: ./configure --with-pddir=../../pd --with-gemdir=../../gem/Gem 

make clean 

make

pix_preview requires the loading of gem library, of course.

Enjoy!!

Thanx for getting here.
