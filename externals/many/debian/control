Description: a Pd library for creating and managing many instances of objects
 This is a library for of techniques for creating and managing many
 instances of an object.
 .
  * bundle: a bundle of instances all connected to the same 
            inlets and outlets
  * instances: many instances that are both individually 
               and globally addressable 
  * instances~: same as [instances] but with outlet~s
  * polypoly~: designed for MIDI polyphony, built upon 
               [poly] and based on [polypoly]
  * voices~: similar to polypoly~, but for generate voice 
             allocation without being tied to MIDI
 .
 Objects in the 'many' lib are based on code from Stephen Pickles'
 (aka pix) nqpoly4 and Frank Barknecht's polypoly.  Thanks to pix's
 nqpoly4 because that was the real groundbreaking work that proved
 that a useful and reliable instance-managing object could be
 programmed in Pd.
