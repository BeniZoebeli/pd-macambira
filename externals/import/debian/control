Description: Pd object for loading libraries within a patch
 Aiming to provide a simplified Python-style import for Pure Data, this import
 object loads libraries as part of a patch.  It will load anything that Pd
 considers a library, including libraries that are defined by Pd loaders like
 'libdir'.
