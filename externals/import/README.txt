[import] allows you to manipulate load library into the patch-local
path from within a Pd patch itself.  This is a very simple version
that does not need any modifications to the core of Pd.  Therefore,
you should make [import] the first object you create in your patch.

To install, copy the "import" folder into your user Pd folder.  You
