# svn:external references to pd-externals hosted in other repositories
#
# adding external-references:
#       - add a new line below with the format: <directory-name> <external link>
#       - the directory must not exist yet
#       - if possible use an external link that would allow commits (for authorized)
#         e.g. "https://" instead of "http://"
#
#       - finally run:
# 		% svn propset svn:externals -F SVNEXTERNALS.txt .
# 		% svn commit
#
# deleting external-references:
# 	- just delete the offending reference and re-run:
# 		% svn propset svn:externals -F SVNEXTERNALS.txt .
# 		% svn commit
#
# you should be able to retrieve this file by running
# 		svn propget svn:externals .
