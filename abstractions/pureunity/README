GOALS

  1. Provide a unit-test framework, which also provide benchmarking features,
     all made in Pd for use in Pd.

  2. Provide tests for functionality in internals, externals, abstractions, etc.,
     in a modularized way, in a DRY/OAOO fashion, thus abstracting out common
     features so that many objects share the same test patch for the features
     that they have in common.
