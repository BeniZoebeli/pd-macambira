GOALS

  1. To provide a unit-test framework, which also provide benchmarking features, 
     all made in Pd for use in Pd.

  2. To provide tests for functionality in internals, externals, abstractions, 
     etc., in a modularized way, in a DRY/OAOO fashion, thus abstracting out
     common features so that many objects share the same test patch for the 
     features that they have in common.

TEST PROTOCOL

  new:
    create common (reusable) fixtures.

  inlet 0:
    bang:
      run all available tests in that class. individual tests don't have
      to be available through individual methods but may. If they do, the
      names of the methods must match those given in the test results. 

      each test should build its own non-reusable fixtures and reinitialize
      common fixtures, not assuming that the previous tests have left the
      common fixtures in a normal state.

  outlet 0:
    test results. a sequence of lists like:
      list $name $passed? $accuracy $elapsed
    for example:
      list 

    where:
      $name is a symbol
      $passed? is either 0 for failure or 1 for success
      $accuracy is a float proportional to relative error on math
         (if not applicable, use 0)
      $elapsed is a float, the time elapsed in milliseconds
         or it is the symbol "-" if not measured.

SEVERITIES (in decreasing order)

 * crash: Segmentation Fault, Bus Error, Illegal Instruction, Infinite Loop, 
   etc.  You can't deal with those errors at the level of the tests. Maybe there 
   should be a way to tell a test object to skip certain tests, by name, in 
   order to be able to perform as many tests as possible while waiting for a 
   fix. It could become possible to rescue from some of those crashes if Pd
   supported exceptions (stack-unwinding).

 * corruption: this may cause future crashes and failures on innocent 
   objects/features. I have no solution for this except to be careful.

 * post(),error(),pd_error(): Gets printed in the console. The problem is that 
   those can't be handled by the test objects, so someone has to read them and 
   interpret them. Also they prevent test objects to ensure that error 
   conditions produce error messages.

 * pd_error2(): I wish this would exist. It would be sort of like pd_error() 
   but it would produce a pd message instead, whose selector would be an 
   error code, designed to be both localizable and [route]able. By default, that 
   message would be sent to the console, but there would be an internal class
   designed to catch those messages. (If stack-unwinding were possible, it would 
   be disabled by default on pd_error2 and could be enabled explicitly 
   by-selector).

 * failure: a test object reports a problem through outlet 0.

 * dropout: a failure in realtimeness... difficult for an object to detect.

 * inaccuracy: a test more or less succeeds but the test detected that the 
   epsilon sucks.
